# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Purpose

With this project, we hope to help researchers improve their coding
skills. One way we do so is by modeling coding community standards of
practice and reproducible workflows. Another way is by welcoming
researchers who are not part of the core team of contributors to
participate.

If you write code for research (or are learning to do so), you are a
coder. That said, we acknowledge that coding communities, like many
communities, have norms that can sometimes feel cryptic and unfriendly
to newcomers. In situations where deviations from these norms --- such
as posing a question in an online forum without following a standard
protocol --- are met with ridicule and snark, newcomers are made to
feel unwelcome. Unfortunately, some newcomers to coding communities
have also been made to feel unwelcome based on aspects of their
identity.

We believe that ridicule, snark, and identity-based exclusion work
against our purpose of improving coding practices and building
community. Accordingly, we will not replicate those practices here and
instead offer a positive pledge of what we will do to foster a
supportive community.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our
project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

In addition, we pledge that questions by community members and
deviations from standards of practice will never be met with
hostility. Rather, we as contributors and maintainers will strive to
be kind and do our best to point community members to helpful
resources.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive
environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
 attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or
 electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in
 a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that
they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its
community. Examples of representing a project or community include
using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official
social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further
defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by contacting Benjamin Skinner directly at
btskinner@coe.ufl.edu or any other member of the core project team:

- [Will Doyle](https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/bio/william-doyle), 
- [Ozan Jaquette](https://emraresearch.org/), 
- [Patricia Martin](https://emraresearch.org/),
- [Karina Salazar](https://www.coe.arizona.edu/karina-g-salazar)
- [Benjamin Skinner](https://btskinner.io)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a
response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct
in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as
determined by other members of the project's leadership.
