# Predicting Bachelor's Degree Completion 


## Concept

The baisc idea is that we work on this project in an open, reproducible format. Our
initial goal is to develop a highly predictive algorithm for predicting bachelor's degree completion
useing data from the 2002 ELS. We'd like to demystify what goes into creating these algorithms, and also describe how they can be used/misused. 

## Data
To begin with, we'll use data on students beginning at four year institutions in academic year 2004, using data from [ELS 2002](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/) via the [online codebook](https://nces.ed.gov/OnlineCodebook/).


## What research question will it answer?

This project will explore the uxe of algorithms to predct student success. In particular, this project will explore how these algorithms reinforce existing inequality. Predicting who does and doesn't currently succeed in our current system says more about the institutions themselves than it does about students, but many times existing patterns of student success are used to justify decisions about who will and won't be given resources. We'd like to explore this tension.

##How will these be communicated?

In addition to traditional academic venues, we anticipate displaying these results in interactive formats.
