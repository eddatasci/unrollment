As higher education decision makers increasingly turn to statistical
and machine learning algorithms to predict student success, they often
do so without a clear understanding of how these algorithms work or
the tradeoffs made when basing decisions upon their predictions. Of
particular concern are hidden biases inherent in an uncritical use of
these algorithms that negatively affect marginalized student
populations. In this project we use `R` to transparently build a
number of predictive algorithms and show how decisions based on their
results might affect underserved student groups in higher
education. We first use publicly available data from the High School
Longitudinal Study and the `tidymodels` framework to evaluate the
predictive accuracy of different modeling approaches, including
elastic net regression, random forests, and neural networks. We next
use predictions from these models to simulate the impact of various
decision frameworks on students, with a particular focus on how
currently underserved groups in higher education would be
affected. Our talk will emphasize both the development process used in
`R` and the results of our analyses.
