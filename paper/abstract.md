In this project we seek to use `R` as an open source platform to provide
transparency around how predictive algorithms in higher education are
estimated and how decisions made on the basis of these algorithms
might affect underrepresented students in higher education. Many times
decision makers in colleges who use these predictive algorithms do not
understand how the predictive models themselves were created nor do
administrators have clear sense of the tradeoffs involved in deploying
the predictions from these models. In the first stage of this project
we use publicly available data from the High School Longitudinal Study
and a model development framework based on the `tidymodels` package in
`R` to evaluate the predictive accuracy of different modeling
approaches, including elastic-net logistic regression, random forests,
and neural networks. In the second stage we simulate the predicted
impact of decision frameworks based on the results of
predictions from the first stage, with a particular focus on how these
results might affect currently marginalized groups in higher
education. Our talk will emphasize both the development process used
in R and the results of our analysis.
