## The Unrollment Project: Exploring Algorithmic Bias in Higher Education

This symposium will provide an overview and a discussion of our
ongoing project exploring the use of predictive algorithms in higher
education decisionmaking.  In this project team members use an open
source platform to provide transparency around how predictive
algorithms in higher education are estimated and how decisions made on
the basis of these algorithms might affect currently marginalized students
in higher education. Predictive algorithms have taken on an important
role in decisionmaking in higher education, and have clear
implications for participation for all. This project seeks to
demistify how these algorithms work and to create a more open
discussion about how these predictive models might affect
participation in higher education. 

Administrators in colleges and universities in the United States have
made increasing use of predictive algorithms for
decision-making. College staff many times use these algorithms to
predict which students will enroll in a given campus, and which
students will complete a degree once enrolled. Once students are
assigned either a predicted probability of an outcome or a predicted
classification, different decisions can be made about how the
institution will work with that student. For instance, students who
are less likely to enroll may be offered less financial aid, as those
funds could be targeted on students who are more likely to
enroll. Similarly, administrators may be less likely to admit a
student when predictive algorithms suggest that the student has a low
probability of completing a degree.

In this project we explore possible biases in predictive models that
could be used to predict access and success in higher education. As a
result of this work we hope to provide transparency around how
predictive algorithms are generated and how decisions made on the
basis of these algorithms might affect currently marginalized groups
in higher education.

In the first stage we use publicly available data from the publicly
available longitdunal studies and a model development framework based
on the “tidymodels” package in the statistical programming language R
to evaluate the predictive accuracy of different modeling approaches,
including logistic regression, elastic-net logistic regression, random
forests, and neural networks.  The “tidymodels” framework allows for a
start-to-finish data science pipeline from data wrangling through
modeling to cross validation of results. In the second stage we
simulate the predicted impact of different decision-making frameworks
based on the results of predictions from the first stage, with a
particular focus on how these results might affect currently
marginalized groups in higher education.

The following panelists will present during the course of the symposium.

Patricia Martin, doctoral student at UCLA and investigator with the
Enrollment Management, Recruiting and Access Group, will provide an
overview of the Unrollment Project, including both the substantive
goals of the project and the process for undertaking research. The
Unrollment project has an unusual structure for higher education
research, where all data and code are publicly available, and research
can be followed in "real time" as researchers post their results and
discussions to GitHub, an open repository for code.  The project
itself has several current key milestones, including the development
of predicitive algorithms for college completion; simulation of
decision-making based on these algorithms; and calculating likely
impacts for different groups of students based on these milestones.

Monique Ositelu, Senior Policy Analyst at the New America Foundation,
will discuss her work on the implications of using predictive
algorithms for individual institutions. These case studies of
institutional decision-making will provide concrete examples of how
predictive algorithms influence administrators' decision-making and
thereby impacting students' chances of success.  

Karina Salazar, Assistant Professor of Higher Education at the
University of Arizona, will discuss how the unrollment project builds
on her previous work regarding spatial discrimination in college
recruiting, and how the use of data analysis can reveal inequalities
in how colleges recruit and retain students.  

Ben Skinner, Assistant Professor of Higher Education at the University
of Florida, will discuss the results of the first stage of the
project, which involves generating predictive algorithms for bachelor's
degree completion among recent high school graduates attending
four-year institutions. The data for this part of the study come from
the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002. Using this data, the
project predicts college graduation based on a large set of
covariates, using four different modeling approaches: logistic
regression, elastic-net logistic regression, random forests and neural
nets. Skinner will summarize the results of these models, including
both standard measures of model fit and summaries of the substantive
importance of these different measures of fit.  

Will Doyle, Professor of Higher Education at Vanderbilt University,
will introduce the panelists and moderate discussions. To provide for
maximum interactivity, Doyle will moderate brief discussions
immediately after each panelist's presentation, with time also
reserved for discussion at the end. Attendees will be encouraged to
access all of the materials made available by the team on GitHub and
to provide their input and recommendations for the project as it
proceeds.
