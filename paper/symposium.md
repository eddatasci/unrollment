## The Unrollment Project: Exploring Algorithmic Bias in Higher Education

This symposium will provide an overview and a chance to dicuss our ongoing project
that explores the use of predictive algorithms in higher education decisionmaking. 
In this project team members use an open source platform to provide
transparency around how predictive algorithms in higher education are
estimated and how decisions made on the basis of these algorithms
might affect underrepresented students in higher education. 
Administrators in colleges and universities in the United States have
made increasing use of predictive algorithms for decision-making.

College staff many times use these algorithms to predict which
students will enroll in a given campus, and which students will
complete a degree once enrolled. Once students are assigned either a
predicted probability of an outcome or a predicted classification,
different decisions can be made about how the institution will work
with that student. For instance, students who are less likely to
enroll may be offered less financial aid, as those funds could be
targeted on students who are more likely to enroll. Similarly,
administrators may be less likely to admit a student when predictive
algorithms suggest that the student has a low probability of
completing a degree. 

In this project we explore possible biases in
predictive models that could be used to predict access and success in
higher education. As a result of this work we hope to provide transparency
around how predictive algorithms are generated and how decisions made
on the basis of these algorithms might affect currently marginalized groups
in higher education.


In the first stage we use publicly available data
from the High School Longitudinal Study and a model development
framework based on the “tidymodels” package in R to evaluate the
predictive accuracy of different modeling approaches, including logistic 
regression, elastic-net logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks.
The “tidymodels” framework allows for a start-to-finish data science
pipeline from data wrangling through modeling to cross validation of
results. In the second stage we simulate the predicted impact of
different decision-making frameworks based on the results of
predictions from the first stage, with a particular focus on how these
results might affect currently marginalized groups in higher
education. 

The following panelists will present during the course of the symposium.

Patricia Martin, doctoral student at UCLA and investigator with the Enrollment 
Management, Recruiting and Access Group, will provide an overview of the
Unrollment Project, including both the substantive goals of the project and the
process for undertaking research. The unrollment project has an unusual structure
for higher education research, where all data and code are publicly available,
and research can be followed in "real time" as researchers
post their results and discussions to GitHub, an open repository for code.
The project itself has several current key milestones, including the development of predicitive algorithms for college completion;
simulation of decision-making based on these algorithms; and calculating likely impacts for different groups of students based on these milestones.
